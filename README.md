# Small-BEC
This is a very small and simple BEC based on the Onsemi MC33269. It is intended to readily provide regulated power from a battery during electronic prototyping or UAS assembly. As the MC33269 is available in 3.3V / 5V / 12V output versions, only one PCB design is needed.

## Electrical Characterstics
The following table summarizes some basic characterstics of MC33269

| Symbol | Description | Value |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| V_in | Voltage Input (Max) | 20V |
| V_out | Voltage Output | 3.3V / 5V / 12V |
| I_limit | Current Limit | 800mA |
| V_in - V_out | Dropout Voltage | 1.1 - 1.35V at 800mA output |
